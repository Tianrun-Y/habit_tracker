When storing data persistently (e.g., in JSON files, databases, or sending over the network):
Store dates as strings, usually in a standard format like ISO 8601 ("YYYY-MM-DD").

JSON and many storage formats don’t support Python’s date or datetime objects directly.

Storing as a string ensures portability and readability.

Example in JSON:

```json
"created_at": "2025-08-08"
```

When working inside your Python program:
Use date or datetime objects to take advantage of date operations (comparing dates, adding days, formatting, etc.).

Convert to string only when saving or displaying.

Workflow example:
python
Copy
Edit
from datetime import date, datetime

# Use date object internally
created_at = date.today()

# Convert to string before saving
created_at_str = created_at.isoformat()  # '2025-08-08'

# When loading from JSON, convert back to date
import json
loaded_str = "2025-08-08"
loaded_date = datetime.strptime(loaded_str, "%Y-%m-%d").date()
Summary:
Store as string in files.

Use date/datetime objects in code.

This keeps data portable and your code clean!
