# Habit Tracker CLI
A simple command-line habit tracker written in Python.

## Forewords
The project exists because I, a novice in the field of software engineering, decided that I needed some more hand-on experiences building a project from start to finish. I chose to build a command-line programme because of my experiences in Python and a research software called GAP. This would be more appropriate than, say, a web app using JavaScript. The topic itself, not exactly exciting, was an option offered by ChatGPT, but I was very clear that the sole purpose of building this project was for me to learn. In the future, having completed more similar projects like this, I can hopefully step into the more original creations.

Ok, back to the programme itself.
